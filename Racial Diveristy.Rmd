First, we read in the data from a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pSZYzFwg87oY8lNInPJNQbQtIovGnNm_Itz_PxUYSoc/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv) I have hosted. It pulls data from the [Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data](http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/DPDP1/0400000US48) and 
The University of Texas At Austin's [Common Data Set (2013-14)](https://www.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/files/IMA_PUB_CDS_2013_AY.pdf).   

Read the chuck in as a CSV
```{r LOAD | from Google Sheet}
url1 <- getURL(paste0("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/",
               "1pSZYzFwg87oY8lNInPJNQbQtIovGnNm_Itz_PxUYSoc",
               "/export?format=csv"))
url2 <- getURL(paste0("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/",
               "1pSZYzFwg87oY8lNInPJNQbQtIovGnNm_Itz_PxUYSoc",
               "/pub?gid=309167376&single=true&output=csv"))

Texas <- read.csv(textConnection(url1))
Colleges <- read.csv(textConnection(url2))

summary(Colleges)
```

```{r}
Colleges <- Colleges %>% melt(measure.vars = c("Men", "Women"), 
                              variable.name = "sex", value.name = "students")
df <- Colleges %>% group_by(College) %>% mutate(percent = students/sum(students))
```

```{r}
qplot(data=df, x=percent, fill=sex, geom="density") + facet_wrap("College")
qplot(data=df, x=percent, fill=College) + facet_grid(Race ~ sex)
qplot(data=df, x=Race)

df %>% 
  ggvis(~students, ~percent, fill = ~factor(Race)) %>% 
  layer_points(
    fill := input_checkboxgroup(
      choices = c("Red" = "r", "Green" = "g", "Blue" = "b"),
      label = "Point color components",
      map = function(val) {
        rgb(0.8 * "r" %in% val, 0.8 * "g" %in% val, 0.8 * "b" %in% val)
      }
    )
  )
  layer_points() %>%
  group_by(Race) %>%
  layer_points()
```
Now, let's find out what it would look like if UT was proportional to the state demographics (roughly). To do this, we need to calculate the percentage of each race `State.Percent`

```{r State Percent}
# Total number of residents in the state
State.Total = sum(Texas$Texas, na.rm=T)

# States racial breakdown as a percentage of population
State.Percent = Texas$Texas / State.Total # Rough breakdown, not accounting for everyone

# Save vector to data frame
Texas$State.Percent <- State.Percent
```

And multiply that by the total number of students at UT

```{r UT by PercentState}
# Total UT students
UT.Total = sum(Texas$Utexas, na.rm=T)

# Find 'ideal' numbers if UT reflected state demographics
UT.by.PercentState = State.Percent * UT.Total

# Bind to data frame
Texas$UT.by.PercentState <- UT.by.PercentState
```

***

```{r}

  group_by(College) %>%
  mutate(Percent.Male = Men/(Men+Women), Percent.Female = Women/(Men+Women)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=College)) + geom_bar(aes(y=Percent.Male))
  qplot(data=Colleges, x=Men, y=Women, color=College, shape=Race)
```

### Plot

```{r PlotStats}
require(ggplot2)
require(ggthemes)

ggplot(Texas, aes(x=Race)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y=UT.by.PercentState/1000), 
           stat = "identity", alpha=I(.8), fill=I("black")) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y=Utexas/1000), 
           stat = "identity", alpha=I(.3), fill=I("green"), color=I("#BF5700")) + 
  labs(y="Number of students at UT", 
       title="Representation of UT Students \nvs Texas Population by race") +
  theme_economist_white() + coord_flip()
